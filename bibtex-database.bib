abstract = {Plates of AA6061-T6 with 4.8. mm of thickness were welded with an ER4043 electrode (1.19. mm in diameter) using the typical simple butt joint to investigate the effect on the mechanical properties of aluminum alloy 6061-T6 due to the Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process. The parameters involved in the welding process were related to the variation of the yield strength and microhardness. A transient thermal analysis was developed to model the problem in a numerical form using Finite Element Method (FEM) and these results were compared with experimental data showing good agreement. It was observed that the amount of energy absorbed by the base material determines the maximum temperatures reached by the aluminum and microstructural changes produced by high metal temperatures, significantly influence the properties of the alloy. For a case with 120. A, 18.0. V and 5.26. mm/s in travel speed, the reduction of yield strength was 45.1\% and for Vickers microhardness was 45.2\%. For another case with 140. A, 20.5. V and 5.36. mm/s in travel speed, the reductions were 40.9\% and 38.4\% for yield strength and Vickers microhardness respectively. The transformation of precipitates ????? in ??' and ?? explain these changes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This work studies the effect of a post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) on the mechanical and microstructure properties of an AA6061 sample welded using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) cold metal transfer (CMT) method. The CMT method was used because the method provides spatter-free welding, outstanding gap bridging properties, low heat input and a high degree of process flexibility. The welded samples were divided into as-welded and PWHT samples. The PWHTs used on the samples were solution heat treatment, water quenching and artificial aging. Both welded samples were cut according to the ASTM E8M-04 standard to obtain the tensile strength and the elongation of the joints. The failure pattern of the tensile tested specimens was analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A Vickers microhardness testing machine was used to measure the hardness across the joints. From the results, the PWHTs were able to enhance the mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of the AA6061 joints welded by the GMAW CMT method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Vaidya2010,
abstract = {Dissimilar welds of aluminium alloy AA6056 and titanium alloy Ti6Al4V were produced by a novel technique. AA6056 sheet was machined at one end to a U-slot shape, enabling the intake of the Ti6Al4V sheet. The Al-alloy U-slot was then butt welded by split laser beam without using a filling wire, thus making a weld by melting only the Al-alloy. Thereby the intermetallic brittle phase TiAl3 formed at the weld interface and affected mechanical properties. As a continuation of the previous work, the joint design was modified by chamfering Ti6Al4V to reduce the formation of interfacial TiAl3. It is shown in this work how this seemingly insignificant joint modification has refined microstructure and increased hardness and strength. The most impressive feature was the improved resistance tofatigue crack propagation whereby the fracture type in the fusion zone of AA6056 adjacent to the weld interface changed from partially intercrystalline to completely transcrystalline. Possible metallurgical processes leading to the property improvements are discussed.},

abstract = {Several developments have been observed in the field of materials processing and welding is a vital metal joining process that has potential industrial applications. Friction welding of tube to tube plate using an external tool (FWTPET) is a relatively newer solid state welding process used for joining tube to tube plate of either similar or dissimilar materials with enhanced mechanical and metallurgical properties. Generally, welding is a multi-input and multi-output process in which there exists a close relationship between the quality of joints and the welding parameters. In the present study, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to predict the strength behavior of FWTPET process. Several Neural Network architectures have been subjected to analysis and the optimal architecture has been determined. The optimal architecture has been used to predict the output process parameter. The predicted output and input parameters have been optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA optimized and experimentally determined process parameters were compared and the deviation is found to be minimal. Besides, the most influential process parameter has been determined using statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
