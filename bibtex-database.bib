abstract = {This work studies the effect of a post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) on the mechanical and microstructure properties of an AA6061 sample welded using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) cold metal transfer (CMT) method. The CMT method was used because the method provides spatter-free welding, outstanding gap bridging properties, low heat input and a high degree of process flexibility. The welded samples were divided into as-welded and PWHT samples. The PWHTs used on the samples were solution heat treatment, water quenching and artificial aging. Both welded samples were cut according to the ASTM E8M-04 standard to obtain the tensile strength and the elongation of the joints. The failure pattern of the tensile tested specimens was analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A Vickers microhardness testing machine was used to measure the hardness across the joints. From the results, the PWHTs were able to enhance the mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of the AA6061 joints welded by the GMAW CMT method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Titanium alloy TiAl6V4 and aluminium alloy 2024-T3 were successfully joined by friction stir welding. Microstructure, hardness and tensile strength of the butt joint were investigated. The weld nugget exhibits a mixture of fine recrystallized grains of aluminium alloy and titanium particles. Hardness profile reveals a sharp decrease at titanium/aluminium interface and evidence of microstructural changes due to welding on the aluminium side. The ultimate tensile strength of the joint reached 73\% of AA2024-T3 base material strength. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Several developments have been occurring in the field of materials processing, and friction welding is an important metal-joining process that has varied industrial applications. Friction welding of tube-to-tube plate using an external tool (FWTPET) is a vital friction welding process which is capable of producing leakproof high-quality weld joints. In the present study, FWTPET welds have been prepared with five different tube preparations. Liquid penetrant test (LPT) has been conducted in order to detect the occurrence of surface defects. Macro- and microstructural studies have been conducted and they reveal that improper weld configuration is susceptible to defect formation. Besides, hardness and tensile strength of five different tube preparations have been presented and analyzed. The present study leads to the production of defect free weld joints which have numerous industrial applications.},
